# Navigating through the world of media

The world of media is exhilarating, and yet it is often so close to our faces that we don't have a chance to look at it critically. That's what this guide will try to cover in general lines, adding to what we built on our [nextbook](https://cjhey.github.io/CRnM/A%20Critical%20Reader%20of%20_New_%20Media.html).


## Cultural analysis as a philosophical practice

The beginnings of cultural analysis as an academic practice are directly tied to important changes to the western world. The air of war and the advent of newer economic ideas, among other factors, brought a renewed look at how culture is <i>done</i>, and how culture <i>should be studied and understood</i>.
One of the figures we studied was [Walter Benjamin (Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin), an essential figure in the beginning of the modern study of culture. Benjamin's life and work, brief and vast each, talks about culture in light of a changing economic landscape. In [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (full text)](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/benjamin.pdf), Benjamin looks at how works of art, facing new modes of production, have seen their usage and position displaced.
What does that mean exactly? Think of the difference between a religious image used in a church and the picture of a religious image in a modern art museum.

### Art, changing art

Traditional ways of looking at art become obsolete due to the changing panorama of art itself. Art, influenced by new technologies, but also new ideas, evolves with our own understanding of culture.
This leads us to both broader questions about the nature of culture, and more narrow questions about the construction of cultural objects.
In what follows, we will explore a couple of those questions in the same vein we explored them in our class.

## Culture, information and change

We have two areas of questioning here. First, the broad question about the nature of culture. Second, the narrow question about how cultural objects are constructed. Let's take up the second topic first.
Let's talk about the word <i>media</i>. Or rather, about the singular of media, <i>medium</i>. Backtracking our usage of the language we commonly assign to the way we obtain cultural objects allows us to think more specifically about what it means for something to be a cultural object by itself, and what a medium might be. There are multiple ways to understand the concept, and it seems common nowadays to talk about media as a <i>thing we consume</i> in a metaphorical sense, such as movies or videogames.
Theories of media, however, pay attention to more than just how we call the things that we consume for entertainment and communication! One important figure we studied in our class was [Marshall McLuhan (Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan). In his [Understanding Media (comments and review on link, Jstor access requires)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23767954) we observe media not simply as platforms where we access contents, but rather as new technologies that change how we interact with people and the world. McLuhan's dictum, ["the medium is the message"](https://marshallmcluhan.com/), is a good way to think of how a given medium works, particularly when that medium conveys some kind of information.

McLuhan, both entertaining and interesting, explains his views here himself:
